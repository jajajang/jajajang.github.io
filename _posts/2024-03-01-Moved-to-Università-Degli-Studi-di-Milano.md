As of March 1st, I have started working as a postdoctoral researcher with Prof. Nicolo Cesa-Bianchi's LAILA (Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence and Learning Algorithms) team for one year. I am delighted to work with Professor Cesa-Bianchi, a luminary in the fields of Online Learning and Multi-Armed Bandits, and I look forward to learning a great deal alongside him.
