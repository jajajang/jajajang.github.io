I am a postdoctoral researcher working with Prof. Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi at Università degil Studi di Milano. Before this, I did my postdoc with Prof. Komiyama Junpei at NYU, and Prof. Kwang-Sung Jun at the University of Arizona. I got my Ph.D. in the Department of Mathematical Science at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) with the advisor Wanmo Kang.

My research interests lie in the mathematical analysis of machine learning problems. More specifically, my research has been focused on

<ul>
  <li>Bandit problems (currently my main interest)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>High-dimensional bandits (sparse, bilinear, etc.)</li>
    <li>Best arm identification</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Generalization bounds (PAC-Bayes bound)</li>
  <li>Generative model (GAN, VAE)</li>
  <li>Other probabilistic tools (Stochastic PDE, Random Matrix Theory, etc......)</li>
</ul>
